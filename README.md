# Cursory for GNU Emacs

Cursory provides a thin wrapper around built-in variables that affect
the style of the Emacs cursor on graphical terminals.  The intent is
to allow the user to define preset configurations such as "block with
slow blinking" or "bar with fast blinking" and set them on demand.
The use-case for such presets is to adapt to evolving interface
requirements and concomitant levels of expected comfort, such as in
the difference between writing and reading.
